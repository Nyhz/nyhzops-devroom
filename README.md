**Autonomous Agent Orchestrator — Tactical Operations Center**

> *"War is ninety percent information."* — Napoleon Bonaparte

DEVROOM is a self-hosted command center for spawning, coordinating, and monitoring autonomous [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) agents. It runs on your local network — deploy missions from any device, watch them execute in real-time, and let the **Overseer** handle the rest.

Built for one operator. Designed like a war room.

---

## The Concept

You are the **Commander**. Your codebase is a **Battlefield**. Every task is a **Mission** — a Claude Code process deployed into an isolated git worktree with a briefing, an objective, and an asset (agent) assigned to carry it out.

Need to coordinate multiple missions across sequential phases? That's a **Campaign**. Plan it interactively with the **STRATEGIST** (a planning-specialized agent), review the operation, then hit **GREEN LIGHT** and watch your phases execute in sequence — missions within each phase running in parallel.

When a mission completes, the **Overseer** reviews the debrief and code diffs, issues a verdict (approve / retry / escalate), and hands approved work to the **Quartermaster** for merging. If confidence is low, the Commander gets a Telegram alert.

Every mission. Every decision. Every token. Logged, tracked, and reported back to Command.

---

## Features

### Mission Deployment & Execution

- **One-click deploy** — Write a briefing, pick an asset, set priority, deploy
- **Isolated worktrees** — Every mission gets its own git branch and worktree. No conflicts. Clean merges on success
- **Live comms** — Real-time streaming output from running agents via Socket.IO
- **Concurrency control** — Configurable parallel agent slots with automatic queue management
- **Rate limit handling** — Exponential backoff with retry (60s x 2^attempt, max 5 retries)
- **Session reuse** — Continue completed or compromised missions with full context preserved
- **Mission templates (Dossiers)** — 10 pre-built briefing templates with variable placeholders for repeat operations

### Campaign Operations

- **Multi-phase campaigns** — Sequential phases, parallel missions within each phase
- **Interactive briefing** — Plan campaigns conversationally with the STRATEGIST asset
- **Plan generation** — STRATEGIST produces structured phase/mission plans from your briefing
- **Visual plan editor** — Drag-and-drop reordering of phases and missions before launch
- **Live timeline** — Track campaign progress across phases in real-time
- **Auto phase transitions** — Next phase begins automatically when current phase is secured
- **Stall detection** — Automatic detection and handling of stuck phases

### Overseer AI — Mission Review Specialist

- **Debrief review** — Evaluates every completed mission: approve / retry / escalate
- **Code diff analysis** — Reviews git diffs and diff stats alongside debriefs for thorough quality assessment
- **Retry loop** — Up to 2 retries for reviewing missions, 1 for compromised — with feedback injected into re-runs
- **Confidence-based escalation** — Approved missions proceed to merge; low-confidence decisions ping the Commander
- **Full audit trail** — Every Overseer verdict logged with reasoning, confidence level, and outcome

### Quartermaster — Merge & Integration Specialist

- **Automated merging** — Approved missions are merged into the target branch automatically
- **Conflict resolution** — Spawns a Claude Code agent to intelligently resolve merge conflicts
- **Worktree cleanup** — Removes worktrees and branches after successful merge
- **Follow-up extraction** — Identifies future work items from mission debriefs

### Asset Roster

**Mission Assets** — the agents you deploy:

| Codename | Specialty | Description |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| **OPERATIVE** | Backend / General | Backend engineering, general-purpose coding |
| **VANGUARD** | Frontend | Frontend engineering with design skills |
| **ARCHITECT** | System Design | Architecture, refactoring, system design |
| **ASSERT** | Testing & QA | Test suites, coverage, quality assurance |
| **INTEL** | Documentation | Docs, bootstrap, project intelligence |

**System Assets** — autonomous support roles:

| Codename | Role | Model |
|----------|------|-------|
| **STRATEGIST** | Campaign planning specialist | Claude Opus 4.6 |
| **OVERSEER** | Mission review & evaluation | Claude Sonnet 4.6 |
| **QUARTERMASTER** | Merge & integration | Claude Sonnet 4.6 |

All mission assets follow strict **Rules of Engagement**: absolute mission scope, report (don't fix) out-of-scope issues, commit discipline, and mandatory debriefs.

### Monitoring & Intelligence

- **HQ Dashboard** — Global operations status, battlefield grid, activity feed, recent missions
- **Overseer's Log** — Searchable audit trail of all review verdicts and escalations
- **Logistics** — Token usage, cost breakdown by battlefield and asset, 30-day usage chart, rate limit status
- **Notifications** — In-app alerts for status changes, escalations, and system events (INFO / WARNING / CRITICAL)
- **Telegram integration** — Real-time escalation alerts with inline action buttons
- **Intel board** — Per-battlefield mission board with backlog and planned columns
- **GENERAL Chat** — Standalone chat with the GENERAL asset for ad-hoc questions

### Git Operations

- **Automatic worktree lifecycle** — Create on deploy, merge on success, cleanup on completion
- **Branch management** — Status, commit log, and branch listing per battlefield
- **Console** — Raw shell access per battlefield for manual operations
- **Dev server management** — Auto-start dev servers for battlefields with the flag enabled
- **Scheduled tasks** — Cron-based recurring missions per battlefield

### War Room

First visit triggers a theatrical boot sequence — progress bars filling, systems coming online, status checks reporting in.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** and **pnpm**
- **Claude Code CLI** installed and authenticated ([docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code))
- A git repository to use as your first battlefield

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nyhz/nyhzops-devroom.git
cd nyhzops-devroom
pnpm install
```

### Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure:

```bash
# Required
DEVROOM_PORT=7777
DEVROOM_CLAUDE_PATH=claude               # Path to your Claude Code binary

# Recommended for unattended operation
CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=                  # From `claude setup-token` (valid ~1 year)

# Optional — Telegram escalation alerts
DEVROOM_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token
DEVROOM_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your-chat-id
DEVROOM_TELEGRAM_ENABLED=true

# Tuning
DEVROOM_MAX_AGENTS=5                      # Max parallel missions (default: 5)
DEVROOM_LOG_LEVEL=info                    # debug | info | warn | error
```

### Database Setup

```bash
pnpm db:migrate    # Apply migrations
pnpm seed          # Seed default assets, dossiers
```

### Launch

```bash
# Development (hot reload via Turbopack)
pnpm dev

# Production
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

Open `http://<your-machine-ip>:7777` from any device on your network.

---

## Native Deployment

DEVROOM runs natively on macOS via `launchd`. No Docker.

### Service Control

```bash
devroom start      # Load and start the launchd service
devroom stop       # Stop and unload the service
devroom restart    # Restart (same mode)
devroom dev        # Switch to dev mode (hot reload) + restart
devroom prod       # Switch to prod mode (full build) + restart
devroom status     # Show service status, mode, uptime, Caddy status
devroom logs       # Tail service log
```

### Setup

The service runs as a user-level launchd agent — no sudo needed:

- **Plist**: `scripts/com.devroom.app.plist`
- **Wrapper**: `scripts/devroom-service.sh` (reads `~/.devroom/mode` for dev/prod)
- **Logs**: `~/.devroom/logs/devroom.log`
- **Auto-restart**: KeepAlive + RunAtLoad enabled
- **Reverse proxy**: Caddy via Homebrew at `https://devroom.lan`

### Auth for Unattended Operation

Claude Code OAuth tokens expire every ~8 hours. For a headless orchestrator, generate a long-lived token:

```bash
claude setup-token   # Interactive — creates a ~1 year token
```

Set `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` in `.env.local`. All spawned processes inherit it automatically.

---

## Usage

### Deploy Your First Mission

1. **Create a Battlefield** — Click `+ NEW BATTLEFIELD` on HQ, point it to a git repo
2. **Bootstrap** — DEVROOM auto-generates a `CLAUDE.md` and `SPEC.md` for the repo
3. **Deploy** — Write a mission briefing, select an asset, hit `DEPLOY`
4. **Monitor** — Watch live comms stream as your agent works
5. **Review** — Overseer auto-reviews the debrief and code diffs. Approved work is merged by the Quartermaster.

### Run a Campaign

1. **New Campaign** — Navigate to Campaigns, create one with an objective
2. **Brief the STRATEGIST** — Chat about what you need. Discuss phases, priorities, constraints.
3. **Generate Plan** — Hit `GENERATE PLAN`. The STRATEGIST structures your conversation into phases and missions.
4. **Review** — Reorder phases, reassign assets, adjust priorities in the plan editor.
5. **GREEN LIGHT** — Launch the campaign. Phases execute in sequence, missions in parallel.
6. **Debrief** — Review results per mission and per phase when complete.

### Mission Recovery

When missions are compromised, the UI shows context-appropriate actions:

| Failure Point | Recovery Action | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| Overseer review failed | **RETRY REVIEW** | Re-runs the Overseer review |
| Overseer rejected work | **RETRY REVIEW** | Re-submits to Overseer |
| Quartermaster merge failed | **RETRY MERGE** | Re-attempts the merge |
| Any failure | **TACTICAL OVERRIDE** | Edit briefing and redeploy with session context |
| Any failure | **CONTINUE MISSION** | Resume session with follow-up instructions |
| Overseer wrong | **APPROVE** | Commander override — you outrank the Overseer |

---

## Dossier Templates

## Design Philosophy

DEVROOM is built around a few convictions:

**Single operator, maximum leverage.** This isn't a team tool. It's a force multiplier for one person running multiple AI agents against real codebases. No auth, no permissions, no collaboration features. Just you and your agents.

**Information density over aesthetics.** Every pixel earns its place. Stats bars, status badges, live comms, token counts — all visible at a glance. The tactical theme isn't decoration; it's a design language optimized for scanning dense, real-time information.

**Autonomous but accountable.** The Overseer reviews every mission so you don't have to babysit each one. The Quartermaster handles merges. But every verdict is logged, every debrief is reviewed, and escalation paths exist for when confidence is low. Trust but verify.

**Git-native isolation.** Every mission gets its own worktree and branch. Agents can't step on each other. Success means a clean merge. Failure means a branch you can inspect or discard. The git history tells the full story.
